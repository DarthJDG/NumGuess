# NumGuess collection

I made this pack as a collection of little sample applications for multiple programming languages. While a small hello world application works, a simple number guessing game shows basic input, output and logic as well.

These programs have been written a long time ago, and mostly in just a few minutes. In no way should they be considered well written or good programming practices.

## Programming languages and compilers:

- **NUMGUESS.ASM**: DOS x86 Assembly (compiles with TASM 3.1)
- **NUM_C64.BAS**: C64 Basic
- **NUMGUESS.BAS**: QBasic 1.0
- **NUMGUESS.C**: Borland C (compiles with 3.1 under DOS)
- **NUMGUESS.CPP**: Borland C++ (compiles with 3.1 under DOS)
- **NUM_OOP.PAS**: Turbo Pascal 6.0 OOP
- **NUMGUESS.PAS**: Turbo Pascal 6.0
- **NUMGUESS.PRG**: dBase IV

## Features:

- **NUMGUESS.ASM**: restart, name, guesses, message
- **NUM_C64.BAS**: restart, guesses, limit, min10
- **NUMGUESS.BAS**: restart, guesses, limit
- **NUMGUESS.C**: guesses, limit, min10
- **NUMGUESS.CPP**: guesses, limit, min10
- **NUM_OOP.PAS**: guesses, limit, min10
- **NUMGUESS.PAS**: guesses, limit, min10
- **NUMGUESS.PRG**: guesses

Feature descriptions:

- *restart*: Asks if you want to play again.
- *name*: Asks for player name.
- *guesses*: Shows number of guesses.
- *message*: Show customised message depending on number of guesses.
- *limit*: Asks for upper limit.
- *min10*: Upper limit must be at least 10 when asked.
