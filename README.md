# NumGuess collection

I made this pack as a collection of little sample applications for multiple programming languages. While a small hello world application works, a simple number guessing game shows basic input, output and logic as well.

These programs have been written a long time ago, and mostly in just a few minutes. In no way should they be considered well written or good programming practices.

## Programming languages and compilers:

- **num_c64.bas**: C64 Basic
- **num_dos.c**: Borland C (compiles with 3.1 under DOS)
- **num_dos.cpp**: Borland C++ (compiles with 3.1 under DOS)
- **num_oop.pas**: Turbo Pascal 6.0 OOP
- **numguess.asm**: DOS x86 Assembly (compiles with TASM 3.1)
- **numguess.bas**: QBasic 1.0
- **numguess.c**: C (compiles with GCC)
- **numguess.cpp**: C++ (compiles with GCC)
- **numguess.pas**: Turbo Pascal 6.0
- **numguess.prg**: dBase IV

## Features:

- **num_c64.bas**: restart, guesses, limit, min10
- **num_dos.c**: guesses, limit, min10
- **num_dos.cpp**: guesses, limit, min10
- **num_oop.pas**: guesses, limit, min10
- **numguess.asm**: restart, name, guesses, message
- **numguess.bas**: restart, guesses, limit
- **numguess.c**: guesses, limit, min10
- **numguess.cpp**: guesses, limit, min10
- **numguess.pas**: guesses, limit, min10
- **numguess.prg**: guesses

Feature descriptions:

- *restart*: Asks if you want to play again.
- *name*: Asks for player name.
- *guesses*: Shows number of guesses.
- *message*: Show customised message depending on number of guesses.
- *limit*: Asks for upper limit.
- *min10*: Upper limit must be at least 10 when asked.
